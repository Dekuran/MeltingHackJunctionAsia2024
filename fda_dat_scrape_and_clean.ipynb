      "<p>Disclaimer: FDA offers this list as a service to the Field Offices. Inclusion of a substance in the Food Additive Status list does not necessarily represent its legal regulatory status. The regulations for food additives in 21 Code of Federal Regulations need to be consulted.</p>\n",
      "<p>NOTE: The Food Additives Status List is provided only as a quick look-up on the use limitations for a food additive. It is possible that mistakes or omissions could have occurred. Additionally, there may be cases where the agency has offered interpretations concerning specific provisions of the regulations. For example, in the case of boiler water additives or other minor ingredients, processing aids, or indirect additives, FDA has not objected, in certain cases, to the substitution of ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium salts for each other when only one is listed in a regulation. The Food Additive Status list is updated at regular intervals, so it may not reflect the latest information. For all these reasons, take care before advising a firm that a use of a particular food additive is prohibited or otherwise limited. Read the actual regulation. If there are any doubts or if a particular situation is unclear, you or your supervisor should consult with the CFSAN, Office of Food Additive Safety (HFS-200) at (240) 402-1200, or the Division of Petition Review (HFS-265) at (240) 402-1264, or the Division of Food Contact Substance Notification Review HFS-275 at (240) 402-1162, or the Division of Biotechnology and GRAS Notice Review HFS-255 at (240) 402-1221.</p>\n",

      "<p>This Food Additives Status List, formerly called Appendix A of the Investigations Operations Manual (IOM), organizes additives found in many parts of 21 CFR into one alphabetized list. Additives included are those specified in the regulations promulgated under the FD&amp;C Act, under Sections 401 (Food Standards), and 409 (Food Additives). The Food Additives Status List includes short notations on use limitations for each additive. For complete information on its use limitations, refer to the specific regulation for each substance. New regulations and revisions are published in current issues of the <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=FR\">Federal Register</a> as promulgated. Also refer to the <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"380956a4-2021-4cfd-9a5e-83b09a60d3fd\" href=\"/food/food-ingredients-packaging/food-ingredient-packaging-inventories\" target=\"\" title=\"Food Ingredient &amp; Packaging Inventories\">Food Ingredient and Packaging inventories</a> in the Foods section of the FDA website to review several FDA databases of additive categories.

Be aware that as a result of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and Antimicrobial Regulation Technical Corrections Act of 1998, EPA now has jurisdiction over sanitizing solutions applied to permanent or semi-permanent food contact surfaces, other than food packaging.
